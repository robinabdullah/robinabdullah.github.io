# Data Management Guidelines

## Central Data Source
- All website content should be managed through [portfolio.json](mdc:src/data/portfolio.json)
- Components should not have hardcoded content that belongs in the data source

## Data Structure
The portfolio.json file is structured to include:
- Personal information
- Professional summary
- Skills and competencies
- Work experience
- Education
- Projects
- Contact information
- Career statistics

## Data Consumption
- Components should implement proper null checking when accessing data
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define data shapes
- Implement data transformation functions separately from rendering logic

## Error Handling
- All components must check for null/undefined values before rendering
- Provide fallback content or graceful degradation when data is missing
- Consider using optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators
